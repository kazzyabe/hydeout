<p>This is a extension of <a href="/projects/2021/01/13/projects-graph.html">the graph-based dependency parser</a>. Instead of training POS tagger and dependency parser separately, it trains them at the same time to avoid the error propagation.</p>

<p>With the parser above, you have to run a POS tagger before running the parser because POS tags are a important feature that is used in the parser. Therefore, the error of the POS tagger is propagated to the parser. To avoid this propagation, a tagger and a parser is trained using the shared features.</p>
