Iâ€™m <strong>Kazuki Yabe</strong>, a <strong>master</strong> student in <strong>Computational Linguistics</strong> at <strong>Indiana University Bloomington</strong>. Iâ€™m from Japan, and I can speack Japanese and English. The picture of Mt. Fuji is posted above to share the beutiful holy mountain when I went back to Japan in 2019. My expected graduation would be May, 2020, and I will have OPT for three years since my major is in the STEM program. Iâ€™m looking for a job which meets my interests (NLP, ML, Linguistics).</p>

<p>Before comming to Indiana, I was in Canada for about 7 years completing my high school and university. I majored in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Linguistcs</strong> at <strong>Simon Fraser University</strong>, and learnt basics of programming and natural language, including algorithm complexity, recursion, searching, syntax, phonetics and etc.</p>

<p>My home is in Koto-ku, which is located at the right edge of Tokyo facing Tokyo Bay. I grew up there until I moved to Canada. Many landmarks, such as Asakusa and Skytree, are accessible by bicycle so it is a good place to stay for visiting Tokyo. I really love the place and miss the great food.</p>

<p>My academic interests include <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>, <strong>Syntax</strong>, <strong>Semantics</strong>, <strong>Phonology</strong>, and <strong>Phonetics</strong>. I have taken some courses for these areas except Phonology and Phonetics, but Iâ€™m planning to take them in my last semester. Iâ€™m looking for a job related to these interests.</p>

<p>My non-academic interests include playing golf, reading comics, watching anime, and playing guitar. I donâ€™t play a lot of game but I play Pokemon Go for several years.</p>
