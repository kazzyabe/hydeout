I'm **Kazuki Yabe**, a **master** student in **Computational Linguistics** at **Indiana University Bloomington**. I'm from Japan, and I can speack Japanese and English. The picture of Mt. Fuji is posted above to share the beutiful holy mountain when I went back to Japan in 2019. My expected graduation would be May, 2020, and I will have OPT for three years since my major is in the STEM program. I'm looking for a job which meets my interests (NLP, ML, Linguistics).

Before comming to Indiana, I was in Canada for about 7 years completing my high school and university. I majored in **Computer Science** and **Linguistcs** at **Simon Fraser University**, and learnt basics of programming and natural language, including algorithm complexity, recursion, searching, syntax, phonetics and etc.

My home is in Koto-ku, which is located at the right edge of Tokyo facing Tokyo Bay. I grew up there until I moved to Canada. Many landmarks, such as Asakusa and Skytree, are accessible by bicycle so it is a good place to stay for visiting Tokyo. I really love the place and miss the great food. 

My academic interests include **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Syntax**, **Semantics**, **Phonology**, and **Phonetics**. I have taken some courses for these areas except Phonology and Phonetics, but I'm planning to take them in my last semester. I'm looking for a job related to these interests.

My non-academic interests include playing golf, reading comics, watching anime, and playing guitar. I don't play a lot of game but I play Pokemon Go for several years.
