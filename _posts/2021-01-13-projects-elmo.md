[Click here for the code](https://github.com/kazzyabe/POS_Elmo)

This is a extension of [the POS tagger with hand-crafted features](/hydeout/projects/2021/01/13/projects-hand.html). Instead of using handcrafted features, Elmo embeddings are used for representing words. Implemented with tensorflow as well.
